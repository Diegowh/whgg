# WHGG

Web application that focuses on providing a service for League of Legends, aiming to deliver in-depth statistics, match history and real-time game analysis.

Currently in development, the platform is in its early stages, and the internal structure may undergo significant changes as it progresses towards an alpha or early deployment phase.

I welcome all forms of collaboration! Feel free to submit a PR or message me for any kind of assistance or support.
